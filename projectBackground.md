Here's an insight on our project background
- This is basically a website where people can leave their reviews about apartments theyâ€™ve lived in, in Regina. Also, those looking to get an apartment can benefit greatly from the reviews.

Looking at the review sites we have worldwide, including the housing ones, you hardly see any information about Regina. Even if there is some information, it would be really limited and frustrating for the individual looking for reviews. This is due to the fact that Regina is a really small city.

We thought it would be a great idea and a large contribution to the Regina community. It would make more sense to have something (a website) that is more detailed and can provide enough information to people. This would really bring ease and comfort to people looking to rent, etc and are finding it hard to get information about the apartment.
